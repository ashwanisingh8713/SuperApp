Venkaiah Naidu has mocked at the exit polls&#44; saying they were not exact polls. \u201cExit polls do not mean exact polls. We have to understand that. Since 1999&#44; most of the exit polls have gone wrong&#44;\u201d the Vice-President pointed out.<\/p><p>Mr. Naidu addressed an informal meeting of well-wishers on May 19&#44; who felicitated him in Guntur. <\/p><p>Referring to the ongoing general elections&#44; he said every party exuded confidence (over victory). \u201cEveryone exhibits his own confidence till the 23rd (day of counting). There will be no base for it. So we have to wait for 23rd&#44;\u201d he remarked.<\/p><p>\u201cCountry and the State need an able leader and stable government&#44; whoever it be.

They are forgetting this basic fact&#44;\u201d he said.<\/p><p>Expressing anguish over the behaviour of elected representatives in Parliament and state legislatures&#44; he said&#44; \u201cSee how MPs are behaving in Parliament and MLAs in Assembly&#44; irrespective of the parties. Panchayat and civic bodies\u2019 members follow them.\u201d<\/p><p>The Vice-President also found fault with political parties announcing freebies to win over the electorate.<\/p><p>\u201cThe way parties are behaving.. you have been given a mandate for five years. You have to work. Without doing that&#44; you announce freebies at the last minute. I am always opposed to it.
