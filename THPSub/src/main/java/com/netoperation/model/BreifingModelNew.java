Mr. Supriyo further told the journalists that \u201ctelevision cameras should show agitating students, they should be identified and rusticated.\u201d This further aggravated the situation and students refused to let him go out without an apology.<\/p><p>Meanwhile the Governor issued a statement arguing that the Union Minister is under \u201c<em>gherao<\/em>...by a section of the students.\u201d He asked the Chief Secretary Malay De, to initiate \u201cprompt\u201d action.
