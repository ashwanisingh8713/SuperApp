Moss finished second in the drivers\u2019 championship four times (1955-58) and third on three occasions. <\/p><p>In 1958&#44; Moss lost out to Ferrari\u2019s Mike Hawthorn by one point despite winning four races to his rival\u2019s one. In 1959&#44; Moss\u2019 car failed during the final race&#44; in Florida&#44; when leading and again in with a chance of the title. <\/p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019ll continue to be described as the greatest driver who never won the world championship&#44; but it doesn\u2019t really matter&#44;\u201d Moss once said. \u201cThe most important thing for me was gaining the respect of the other drivers and I think I achieved that.\u201d<\/p><p>When his resolve to drive solely for English teams waned&#44; Moss raced for Maserati&#44; Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz \u2014 partnering Fangio in an all-star line-up. In total&#44; Moss raced in 107 different types of car and boasted a record of 212 wins in the 375 competitive races he finished.<\/p><h2>Early life and end of career<\/h2><p>Moss was born in 1929 into a racing family. His father&#44; Alfred&#44; competed in the Indianapolis 500; his mother&#44; Aileen&#44; was English women\u2019s champion in 1936. The young Moss learned his trade during a racing boom in England after World War II. His knowledge of racing cars was second to none and he took his profession to the extreme&#44; experimenting and risking his own safety in the process.<\/p><p>He broke both legs and damaged his spine in a crash in 1960. Even worse was the accident in Goodwood&#44; England&#44; two years later&#44; when he careered into a bank of earth at 100 mph (160 kph) without a seatbelt while competing in the Formula One Glover Trophy.<\/p><p>It took 45 minutes to cut him from the wreckage. He suffered brain injuries&#44; and his body\u2019s left side was partially paralysed for six months. With his eyesight and reflexes also permanently damaged&#44; Moss quit racing. \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t get out&#44; I\u2019d kill myself and maybe somebody else&#44;\u201d Moss said. <\/p><p>Moss then became a successful businessman&#44; selling property and designing gadgets out of his state-of-the-art home in central London and working as a consultant to car manufacturers. He received a knighthood in 1999. In 2010&#44; he broke both ankles and hurt his back in a fall three floors down an elevator shaft at home. <\/p><p>\u201cHis body still has the same resilience to injury as it did in his racing days&#44;\u201d a statement on his website read. <\/p>","short_de":"\n \nStirling Moss&#44; a daring&#44; speed-loving Englishman regarded as the greatest Formula One driver never to win the world championship&#44; has died.

The lethal combination of an interconnected world and a deadly virus without a cure is taking humanity into uncharted waters. When we emerge from the lockdown&#44; we must be ready to confront new political and social realities.<\/p><h2>Crumbling world order<\/h2><p>The rampant spread of COVID-19 is also a failure of the contemporary world order and its institutions. The contemporary global order&#44; whatever remains of the institutions created by the victors of World War II&#44; was a hegemonic exercise meant to deal with isolated political and military crises and not serve humanity at large. COVID-19 has exposed this as well as the worst nativist tendencies of the global leadership in the face of a major crisis. That the United Nations Security Council took so long to meet (that too inconclusively) to discuss the pandemic is a ringing testimony to the UN\u2019s insignificance.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/topic/coronavirus/\">Coronavirus<\/a> | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/will-covid-19-affect-the-course-of-globalisation/article31303655.ece\">Will COVID-19 affect the course of globalisation?<\/a><\/p><p>Regional institutions haven\u2019t fared any better. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s SAARC initiative&#44; curiously resurrecting a practically dead institution&#44; was short-lived. The EU&#44; the most progressive post-national regional arrangement&#44; stood clueless when the virus spread like wildfire in Europe. Its member states turned inward for solutions: self-help&#44; not regional coordination&#44; was their first instinct. Brussels is the loser.<\/p><p>All this is indicative of a deeper malaise: the global institutional framework is unrepresentative&#44; a pawn in the hands of the great powers&#44; cash-strapped&#44; and its agenda is focused on high-table security issues. The global institutional architecture of the 1940s cannot help humanity face the challenges of the 2020s. Nothing less than a new social contract between states and the international system can save our future.<\/p><p>One country that is likely to come out stronger from this crisis is China. Reports indicate that China has now managed the outbreak of COVID-19&#44; and its industrial production is recovering even as that of every other country is taking a hit. The oil price slump will make its recovery even faster. When the greatest military power found itself in denial mode and the members of the EU were looking after their own interests&#44; China appeared to use its manufacturing power to its geopolitical advantage. Beijing has offered medical aid and expertise to those in need; it has increased cooperation with its arch-rival Japan; and President Xi Jinping spoke to the UN Secretary General on how the international community can fight the virus. Its richest man&#44; Jack Ma&#44; has spearheaded the private sector\u2019s fight against COVID-19. The Chinese propaganda machinery will magnify this. Chinese actions are a smart economic investment for geopolitical gains. This will aid Beijing\u2019s claims to global leadership&#44; push Huawei 5G trials as a side bargain&#44; and showcase how the Belt and Road Initiative is the future of global connectivity. COVID-19 will further push the international system into a world with Chinese characteristics.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/specials/coronavirus-opeds-and-editorials/article31234013.ece\">Coronavirus | Opeds and editorials<\/a><\/p><p>Neoliberal economic globalisation will have taken a major beating in the wake of the pandemic. Economists are warning of a global recession. Even as the virus is pushing back the \u2018successes\u2019 of neoliberal globalisation&#44; globalisation\u2019s political counterpart is found wanting in dealing with the situation. The first instinct of every major economy was to close borders&#44; look inwards and localise. The pre-existing structural weakness of the global order and the COVID-19 shock will further feed states\u2019 protectionist tendencies fueled by hypernationalism. A more inclusive global political and economic order is unlikely any time soon&#44; if ever. Instead&#44; as former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon warns&#44; \u201cwe are headed for a poorer&#44; meaner&#44; and smaller world.\u201d<\/p><p>The ability of big corporations to dictate the production&#44; stocks&#44; supply chains and backup plans will be limited by increased state intervention to avoid unpredictable supply sources&#44; avoid geopolitically sensitive zones&#44; and national demands for emergency reserves. The profits of big corporations will reduce&#44; and the demand for stability will increase.<\/p><p>Some would gladly argue all this could potentially mean a retreat from hyperglobalisation and its attendant flaws. However&#44; the assumption that COVID-19 will bring about a more balanced and inclusive form of economic and political globalisation is perhaps misplaced. State intervention in economic matters and protectionism are the easy way out&#44; and that\u2019s precisely what states will do once the crisis is over. It would be return of the \u2018Licence Raj\u2019 through the backdoor&#44; not a push for inclusive and responsible globalisation with its associated political benefits.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/topic/coronavirus/\">Coronavirus<\/a> | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/beyond-social-distancing-to-fight-covid-19/article31221877.ece\">Beyond social distancing to fight COVID-19<\/a><\/p><p>The state has failed in its inability to save us from the pandemic notwithstanding its tall claims about national security preparedness. And yet&#44; the state has returned&#44; with more power&#44; legitimacy and surveillance technologies. In fact&#44; the nervous citizenry will want the state to be omnipresent and omnipotent&#44; no matter the consequences. The state&#44; which was losing its influence to global economic forces&#44; will return as the last refuge of the people in the coming age of mass disruption.<\/p><p>With the severe beating that globalisation has taken&#44; state-led models of globalisation and economic development would be preferred over (big) corporates-led globalisation. Will this enable some positive controls over the inherent deficiencies of globalisation? We will have to wait and see. But the more important question is whether the state has any incentive to take on big capital. Given the symbiotic relationship between the state and big capital&#44; states have become used to protecting the interests of their corporations&#44; often at the cost of the general public. Consider&#44; for instance&#44; that the first response of many Western states was to protect their capital markets than be concerned about public health.<\/p><h2>New-age racism<\/h2><p>Yet another undesirable outcome of the pandemic would be a spike in various forms of discrimination. Globally&#44; societies could become more self-seeking and inward-looking leading to further pushback against liberal policies regarding migration and refugees. New questions are likely to be asked about the source of goods. More stringent imposition of phytosanitary measures by advanced states on products emanating from the less developed countries might become the new normal. Lockdowns and travel restrictions could potentially legitimise the rhetoric around border walls in more conservative countries. Tragically&#44; therefore&#44; while one answer to global pandemics is political globalisation&#44; COVID-19 might further limit it.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/topic/coronavirus/\">Coronavirus<\/a> | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-african-nations-us-decry-racism-in-chinese-city-of-guangzhou/article31319084.ece\">African nations&#44; U.S. decry racism in Guangzhou<\/a><\/p><p>Within India too&#44; there could be a trend towards discrimination&#44; with \u2018social distancing\u2019 producing undesirable social practices. That a Manipuri woman was spat on in Delhi by a man who called her \u201ccoronavirus\u201d&#44; and gated communities have discriminated against those in COVID-19 quarantine&#44; indicate a new age of discrimination.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a huge spike in domestic violence against women in China&#44; Australia&#44; France&#44; the U.K.&#44; Spain&#44; and Bangladesh&#44; among others. In India&#44; too&#44; the National Commission for Women has reported a large increase in distress calls from victims of domestic violence since the pandemic broke out.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-lockdown-spike-in-domestic-violence-says-ncw/article31238659.ece\">Coronavirus lockdown <\/a>| <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-lockdown-for-abuse/article31292334.ece\">No lockdown for abuse<\/a><\/p><h2>Home&#44; not safe for many<\/h2><p>The national strategy against COVID -19 emphasises that home is the safest place to be. Ironically&#44; for domestic violence victims&#44; home is the most unsafe place to be quarantined as they are forced to live with their abusers. Although asking people to stay at home is an effective and welcome anti-COVID-19 strategy&#44; home is not the safe haven it should be for many women because abusers have increased access to their victims and survivors have decreased or no access to resources.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-lockdown-spike-in-domestic-violence-says-ncw/article31238659.ece\">Coronavirus lockdown | Rise in domestic violence&#44; police apathy: NCW<\/a><\/p><p>Domestic violence can be verbal&#44; financial&#44; psychological and sexual. It includes the abuser withholding financial or medical assistance. Women are most often the caregivers for those quarantined at home and already infected with the virus&#44; which makes them more vulnerable to contracting the disease.<\/p><p>Domestic violence is rooted in the inequities of power and control. The abusers feel an enormous loss of power and control over their own lives due to the pandemic. They vent their frustration on the women in the house. Mental health issues arise out of isolation as well as reactive depression&#44; but instead of recognising these issues and seeking help&#44; people become violent. <\/p><p>The victims are not only unable to speak out because they are quarantined at home with the perpetrators&#44; but also because the lockdown prevents them from seeking help outside.

Priority measures to help domestic violence victims&#44; without detracting from the overall anti-COVID-19 strategy of lockdown&#44; should be initiated by the government&#44; and steps to protect victims of domestic violence be made a part of overall anti-COVID-19 action plans.<\/p><p> Coronavirus lockdown | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-rolls-out-steps-for-womens-safety/article31292540.ece\">Centre rolls out steps for women\u2019s safety<\/a><\/p><p>UN Women has said that \u201chelplines&#44; psychosocial support and online counselling should be boosted&#44; using technology-based solutions such as SMS&#44; online tools and networks to expand social support&#44; and to reach women with no access to phones or Internet.\u201d Other priorities include a more responsive police force&#44; and other government agencies who are not dismissive of domestic violence complaints.

I do have a companion weekly column in this newspaper&#44; \u2018Notebook\u2019&#44; where journalists share the responsibility of fostering media literacy. Unlike academic disciplines&#44; media literacy does not have a rigid curriculum. It is an evolving discipline and draws its substantial inputs from journalists who are successful in reconciling freedom with responsibility. The \u2018Notebook\u2019&#44; \u201cCurating news for children during pandemic\u201d&#44; (April 10) by Krithika Reddy T.&#44; reflects on the present lacunae in addressing the needs of students and what can be done during this lockdown. <\/p><h2>The ban on hydroxychloroquine<\/h2><p>One of the defining elements of good journalism is to provide space for rigorous examination of issues&#44; based on evidence&#44; research and academic review&#44; in an accessible language. A reader from Pollachi&#44; A. Balagangadharan&#44; was unhappy with <em>The Hindu<\/em>\u2019s report&#44; \u201cIndia lifts ban on export of hydroxychloroquine\u201d (April 8). He felt that while the front-page report emphasised that the ban was lifted after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warning of a \u201cretaliation\u201d&#44; the Ministry of External Affairs\u2019 statement was deliberately pushed to the inside pages. Three more letters suggested that the newspaper should have glossed over the \u201cretaliation\u201d warning and focussed instead only on the humanitarian gesture of the Indian state. <\/p><p>It is my fervent hope that readers realise the importance of credible information that is not subjected to censorship. Journalism is a presentation of our complex interlocking public. Let us examine how hydroxychloroquine itself represents an interlocking public. First&#44; the newspaper\u2019s position was articulated in its editorial&#44; \u201cIn time of need\u201d (April 10)&#44; where it said that \u201cirrespective of whether India bowed to U.S. pressure&#44; it is unlikely to run out of the drug.\u201d The editorial also flagged questions about the efficacy of the drug in treating COVID-19 based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s position of April 7 that \u201cthere is no drug available to prevent or treat COVID-19.\u201d<\/p><p>On April 7&#44; the online edition of the newspaper carried an important article by the Science Editor&#44; R. Prasad&#44; \u201cHydroxychloroquine: publisher expresses \u2018concerns\u2019 about study\u201d. The article explained that 10 days after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis by healthcare workers attending to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases&#44; the publisher of an international journal that published a study on the drug\u2019s purported efficacy expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about the paper. The paper was published on March 17 in the <em>International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents<\/em>. On April 3&#44; the journal\u2019s publisher&#44; the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy&#44; said: \u201cThe ISAC Board believes the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard&#44; especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d The unusual haste with which the paper was published is disturbing. As <em>The Hindu <\/em>report pointed out&#44; \u201cthe paper was published a day after it was submitted to the journal&#44; and one of the authors was Editor-in-Chief of the journal.\u201d<\/p><h2>Looking at journals cautiously<\/h2><p>The hydroxychloroquine controversy has forced journalists to even look at journals cautiously. On April 7&#44; the day <em>The Hindu<\/em> expressed doubts on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine&#44; <em>The Guardian<\/em> carried a report&#44; \u201cHydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus \u2018miracle cure\u2019\u201d. It explained how the hydroxychloroquine story \u201cis a distinctly modern tale of misinformation within a global information ecosystem beset by widespread uncertainty&#44; fear&#44; media fragmentation and hyper-partisanship.\u201d<\/p><p> In its situation report 13&#44; the World Health Organization said that the \u201c2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a \u2018infodemic\u2019\u201d \u2014 some accurate and some not. And this does not include the underplaying of threats by various governments from China to the U.S. Along with these global issues&#44; Indian journalists have to confront an additional burden: communalisation. Responsible journalism is to report the facts and not deepen social fissures. It was \u2014 and is \u2014 a demanding task. <\/p><p><span class=\"ng_tagline_credit\">readerseditor@thehindu.co.in <\/span><\/p>","short_de":"\n \nAt this time of COVID-19-induced physical distancing&#44; it is rather cruel to repeat the refrain of news ombudsmen that ours is a lonely job.

The past week has seen a bit of a change&#44; but it has taken weeks for the Centre to begin consulting the States.<\/p><p>The most productive effort will be an equal partnership between the Centre and the States. Some States began preparation well before the Centre woke up to the seriousness of COVID-19.

Are the States then to take the blame if the strategy does not succeed?<\/p><h2>Shun the centralisation<\/h2><p>Three&#44; centralisation of decision-making in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office is the worst thing in a country-wide crisis. So far everything has been centred around the Prime Minister. The Union Cabinet is only busy tweeting in support of the Prime Minister. The Health Minister is nowhere to be seen. A small group of hand-picked bureaucrats is taking all the major decisions and directing the response. This should not be so.<\/p><p>Four&#44; some forethought is advisable even in \u201cbig bang\u201d decisions. We should have thought about <em>Jaan bhi<\/em>&#44; <em>Jahaan bhi <\/em>(\u201cLife and economy are both important\u201d) before imposing the lockdown&#44; not now three weeks later. We should not have messaged the lockdown as an act done in fear or as a \u201ccurfew\u201d but as a difficult decision in which the government would be with the citizen right through. If it was cruel not to first assure the migrants that they would be supported during the lockdown&#44; it has been worse not to have later quickly made amends.<\/p><h2>Open the fund tap<\/h2><p>Five&#44; we can surely be more generous with how we can support the millions who have been brutally affected by the stop to most economic activity. Yet&#44; it is amazing how stingy \u2014 yes&#44; that is the word \u2013 the Centre has been so far with its relief measures. It should also be giving the States more resources for their health services and expanded welfare programmes. But it is unbelievable that even today the Centre is refusing to release the States\u2019 share in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues.<\/p><p>There have been many suggestions on how to ameliorate the immediate despair&#44; repair the supply lines and fund what needs to be done now and in the future. If only the Centre had an open mind.<\/p><p>Six&#44; uncertainty and fear among the people calls for assurance from the highest levels on a regular basis&#44; indeed every day&#44; about what is being done. This would also signal that the Centre is sensitive to the difficulties that citizens are experiencing. The Centre can do this only if it sheds its dislike of the press&#44; and not offer obfuscations by mid-level officials as is now happening. Yet&#44; it went even further and asked the Supreme Court to place restrictions on how the media disseminates information on COVID-19.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/resources/the-hindus-e-book-on-covid-19-in-multiple-indian-languages/article31174374.ece\">Download <em>The Hindu<\/em>\u2019s multi-language e-book on essential COVID-19 information<\/a><\/p><p>Compare this attitude with that of the Chief Minister of Kerala. Detailed daily press briefings have built confidence in the State Government\u2019s efforts&#44; so much so that the residents of Kerala have now shed their fear. In the process&#44; a Chief Minister who was earlier seen as a polarising figure has united the State in this crisis&#44; and he has come to be universally admired.<\/p><h2>Quell social tensions<\/h2><p>Seven&#44; India must be unique in the world for increasing social tensions in such times. After many members of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi were found infected&#44; an intense wave of Islamophobia has swept the TV channels and social media. The Muslim community is blamed for waging a \u201ccorona jihad\u201d. The result is social ostracism in parts of the country&#44; economic boycotts and an open expression of hate. If the BJP leadership had used its enormous political capital to speak forcefully against this trend&#44; the rabble-rousers would have fallen in line. Its silence should make us afraid of what is to come.<\/p><p>Eight&#44; the path we have chosen of lockdowns and containment to slow the transmission of COVID-19 may call for more (even if shorter) lockdowns in the future. An extended lockdown may make sense in an advanced economy where organised activity is the norm&#44; but in India where there is so much of day-to-day survival and so little social security? Can our society cope with such an assault on the fabric of livelihoods? Is it not time to ask if the cure we are administering is going to be worse than the disease? Should we not begin to discuss alternatives?<\/p><h2>Unite for the reconstruction<\/h2><p>The economy cannot be operated with an off-on switch. It is going to be a long and hard process to rebuild the economy and rescue the livelihoods of millions of people in rural and urban India that have been weakened&#44; if not destroyed altogether. That is why we need a collective national effort at reconstruction. Or were millions deprived of their daily earnings only so that COVID-19 would not spread to the clangers of pots and pans and lighters of candles&#44; the more privileged among us?<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/topic/coronavirus/\">Coronavirus<\/a> | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-india-braces-for-a-rapid-surge-in-cases/article31325392.ece?homepage=true\">Bracing for a rapid surge in cases&#44; says government<\/a><\/p><p>There are doctors&#44; paramedics and accredited social health activists&#44; or ASHAs&#44; across the country who are working tirelessly.

We already have heroines like the nurse in Kerala who cared for an elderly COVID-19 couple&#44; fell ill herself&#44; recovered and now wants to rejoin duty. But there has been a larger failure of humanity in how the rest of us have responded. We can yet recover that humanity if the political leadership shows the way.<\/p><p>The propaganda machine tells us that we have been doing well. Let us not be fooled. We are in the middle of a humanitarian disaster that would have been worse but for the efforts of the State governments. If we want to&#44; we can still rise to meet the crisis. For that&#44; we need a largeness of political vision that would enable a true collective effort at all levels of government and by all sections of society.<\/p><p><em><span class=\"ng_tagline_credit\">C.

This can have grave consequences&#44; especially where the penetration of mobile telephony and social media exceeds that of education and awareness. <\/p><p>Editorial | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/uncritical-endorsement-the-hindu-editorial-on-exodus-of-migrant-workers-and-the-supreme-court/article31230325.ece\">Uncritical endorsement: On exodus of migrant workers and the Supreme Court<\/a><\/p><p>For many who engage in political discourse&#44; however&#44; \u201cfake news\u201d is used as an epithet to describe any critical comment or opposing viewpoint. By branding criticism as \u201cfake news\u201d&#44; governments draw on the consensus that fake news is pernicious&#44; obviating the need to respond to the content of the criticism. If it is fake news&#44; after all&#44; it merits no response. Used in this way&#44; the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d is used as an antidote to any opposition or critique. <\/p><p>Such usage is disingenuous. News reports facts. \u201cFake news\u201d is a report of facts that are knowingly false&#44; presented as \u201cnews\u201d. By definition&#44; news is not opinion&#44; which can be wrong&#44; but it cannot be \u201cfake\u201d. Therefore&#44; an opinion that you disagree with&#44; cannot be branded as \u201cfake news\u201d&#44; because it is just that&#44; opinion. You cannot&#44; by mischaracterising criticism as \u201cfake news\u201d&#44; escape from having to respond to it. <\/p><h2>Response needed<\/h2><p>Contemporary political discourse has taken this dangerous approach a step further. Where governments are criticised for causing suffering among their people&#44; the suffering is instead attributed to the menace of \u201cfake news\u201d. For example&#44; after the precipitous announcement of lockdown&#44; the government has been criticised for failing to anticipate the exodus of migrant workers; failing to make advance provision for food&#44; shelter or salaries; failing to communicate with State governments to formulate a coordinated approach before the lockdown; and failing to communicate with the public regarding what migrant workers should do in view of the lockdown. <\/p><p>Full coverage | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/specials/lockdown-displaces-lakhs-of-migrants/article31214375.ece\">Lockdown displaces lakhs of migrants<\/a><\/p><p>The government\u2019s response to the mass exodus was&#44; by any yardstick&#44; uncoordinated&#44; where initially there was abject confusion&#44; then the States reportedly provided vehicles to ferry the workers&#44; and&#44; finally&#44; the States were directed to seal their borders. The human loss was incalculable&#44; with hundreds of thousands undertaking Partition-esque journeys across hundreds of kilometres in a desperate bid to return home&#44; leading to the tragic loss of lives and enormous suffering that are yet to be fully documented. The newspapers continue to report that food and shelter are still not reaching many of the migrant workers. These criticisms certainly deserve a response. <\/p><p>Instead of responding&#44; the government&#44; on affidavit to the Supreme Court of India in response to petitions that migrant workers need to be provided for during lockdown&#44; says that the only culprit for the loss of life and hardship of migrant workers is&#44; simply&#44; \u201cfake news\u201d. Apparently&#44; the sole reason that migrant workers undertook the punishing journey back home across hundreds of kilometres back home was \u201cfake news\u201d that the lockdown would extend to three months rather than three weeks. The prospect of three weeks without food&#44; shelter or basic amenities was&#44; according to the government&#44; not devastating enough to motivate workers to return home. Fake news is apparently to blame for upsetting the government\u2019s careful calculation that millions of migrant workers would have serenely stayed put and there would have been no hardship whatsoever. <\/p><p>Also read | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-in-bareilly-migrants-forced-to-take-bath-in-the-open-with-sanitiser/article31204430.ece\">In Bareilly&#44; migrants returning home sprayed with 'disinfectant'<\/a><\/p><p>This begs a raft of questions: \u201cFake news\u201d is a statement that is knowingly false \u2014 what was the false statement that constituted \u201cfake news\u201d in this case? Was it the announcement of relief measures for three months by the Finance Minister triggering speculation that the 21-day lockdown could be extended to June 30? Isn\u2019t the government extending the lockdown and isn\u2019t its eventual duration still uncertain? Was extending the lockdown a decision that the government could even have taken on March 24&#44; or would it depend on an assessment of the situation closer to April 14? Could any of us&#44; including the government&#44; categorically have said on March 24 that the lockdown would not be extended&#44; depending on the situation prevailing on April 14? Was the government itself the source of what it is now calling \u201cfake news\u201d?<\/p><p>The government cannot be permitted&#44; by the artifice of \u201cfake news\u201d&#44; to bypass the criticism that it should have planned better&#44; coordinated between Centre and State governments&#44; and been clear in strategy and communication. These are not hindsight criticisms either. Lessons could and should have been learned from deficiencies in similar announcements made earlier by foreign governments regarding COVID-19 measures. Chanting the mantra of \u201cfake news\u201d cannot wish away these questions. <\/p><p>Also read | <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lockdown-migrant-workers-come-out-on-road-demanding-salaries/article31313403.ece\">Migrant workers in Surat come out on road demanding salaries<\/a><\/p><h2>Court\u2019s line<\/h2><p>The Supreme Court passed an order on March 31 directing the media to carry the official version of events of the pandemic&#44; which the government is to publish on a daily basis. With little to go on other than the government\u2019s fervid assertions that it had taken more than adequate measures in response to COVID-19&#44; the Court perhaps did not want to enter the thicket of whether better government planning and communication could have avoided or reduced the suffering of migrant workers&#44; or whether the source of the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d was the government itself. The Court&#44; fortunately&#44; made clear that it did not intend to stifle discussion of the pandemic&#44; else even this piece could not have been published. If false information circulated on social media is dangerous because it can trigger action&#44; misleading statements or lack of clarity in government messaging is even more dangerous&#44; given the credibility of the source. What \u201cfake news\u201d is not&#44; is a dissenting opinion or a viewpoint the establishment does not like. No government should be permitted to hide behind a vague assertion of \u201cfake news\u201d to abdicate responsibility for its actions.

In an email interview to <strong>The Hindu<\/strong>&#44; he explains the debate on BCG vaccine\u2019s purported effectiveness against <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/topic/coronavirus/\" title=\"\">COVID-19 <\/a>and how global approaches to communicable diseases might change.<\/em><\/p><h2>You have advised against over optimism with regards to the link between BCG and COVID-19 immunity. What are your reasons?<\/h2><p>As a tuberculosis (TB) researcher who was born in India&#44; I would be thrilled if BCG worked against COVID-19. It is a cheap&#44; readily available&#44; safe vaccine. But we are not there yet. Currently&#44; what we have are a few ecological studies (not peer-reviewed) which take country-level BCG and COVID-19 data&#44; and report a correlation that countries that give BCG to children have a lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Based on this early signal and based on our prior knowledge that BCG does have non-specific immune-boosting properties&#44; it is perfectly fine to conduct trials to confirm the hypothesis. Indeed&#44; such trials are starting in the U.S.&#44; Netherlands and Australia. I welcome that.<\/p><p>  <\/p><p>But the current ecological evidence is far from sufficient for any immediate public health or clinical use during this crisis. Ecological studies offer a very weak level of evidence because correlations that are true at the country level might not hold true at the individual level. For example&#44; we know not everyone who lives in a low-income country is poor \u2014 some individuals are very rich. Same logic applies to ecological comparisons. In addition&#44; ecological studies have been done at a time when the epidemic is exploding in many low/middle income countries. Repeating the studies in a month might produce different results. We also know many low/middle income countries&#44; including India&#44; are seriously under-testing for COVID-19. Lastly&#44; there is also bias due to confounding \u2013 countries that give BCG are mostly in Asia&#44; Africa and Latin America&#44; with much younger populations than Europe or North America.<\/p><p>I understand everyone is desperate for some good news&#44; but we cannot abandon good science. So&#44; until trial results are out&#44; countries like India must focus on interventions such as largescale testing&#44; isolation&#44; contact-tracing&#44; and physical distancing (where feasible). During lockdown&#44; the most vulnerable&#44; poorest people must receive cash and social benefits. India should also ensure personal protection equipment to all healthcare care providers and strengthen hospital capacity to deal with severely ill patients. It would be dangerous for policy-makers to assume protection from BCG and not act. That is why I am worried about all the media hype.<\/p><h2>TB continues to kill thousands of people in India. How might coronavirus affect TB services in India and what can be done about that? <\/h2><p>\n<\/p><p>This is my biggest worry \u2013 even without COVID-19&#44; TB kills 1&#44;000 Indians every day. No country has more TB patients than India. And now&#44; with the lockdown&#44; things are going to get much worse. Already&#44; there are preliminary reports of a 80% decline in TB case notifications. People on TB treatment are struggling to get their medicines on time&#44; and people with new TB symptoms are unable to access medical care. TB patients and survivors often have lung damage and if they got COVID-19&#44; they could be at higher risk of complications. I worry about an increase in TB mortality in the coming months&#44; and that will be so sad. There is also the risk of running out of anti-TB medicines&#44; since India relies heavily on China for raw materials.<\/p><p>What can be done to avert this disaster? Right now&#44; all known TB patients could be supported via remote or tele-consultations using call centres&#44; or other digital technologies. Drugs could be sent to their homes via couriers or through local pharmacies (that are still open). For any new TB patient&#44; TB medicines could be given for a longer duration (e.g. 2 or 3 months) to ensure they have enough. India could work with generic drug companies and proactively plan for increasing anti-TB drug production to make sure stocks don\u2019t run out in a few months. If the public sector gets overwhelmed with COVID-19&#44; this crisis is a good opportunity for the private health sector to pitch in and take care of TB patients.<\/p><h2>Has the TB programme lessons for the COVID-19 response? Or vice versa?<\/h2><p>  <\/p><p>Yes&#44; TB programmes are known for public health interventions such as active case finding&#44; contact investigations&#44; respiratory isolation&#44; and community-based patient support. These skills and expertise could be leveraged to tackle COVID-19. Also&#44; some of the existing TB technologies could come in handy. For example&#44; India has two molecular technologies in use (GeneXpert by Cepheid and TrueNat by Molbio) that are used for TB testing and both can now be used to test for COVID-19. India is already using digital adherence technologies such as 99DOTS and Everwell Hub and these could be repurposed to also work for COVID-19.<\/p><p>India has shown great commitment to tackling COVID-19 in a short period of time. I wish some of that commitment will also be shown to tackling TB&#44; which has killed millions of Indians over the years. Historically&#44; TB control has received little political attention&#44; funding or popular support. After the pandemic&#44; the Indian National TB elimination programme will need a lot more funding than they have now. I hope existing TB funding will not be diverted towards COVID-19. That would be disastrous.<\/p><h2>How can a country prepare for a pandemic?<\/h2><p>I don\u2019t think any country in the world was adequately prepared for COVID-19. Even the richest countries in the world are struggling right now. A big lesson for India and many other countries is that no country can prepare for a crisis within days or weeks. Being prepared means having a robust healthcare system&#44; especially primary healthcare. In short&#44; universal health coverage is a pre-requisite for real preparedness.<\/p><p>We know India has failed to invest in health for decades&#44; barely spending 1.5% of the GDP on health. Even the bare minimum recommended health spend of 2.5% of GDP has not been realised. This chronic under-investment has left the public health system weak&#44; and has allowed the private and informal health sectors to thrive. This means&#44; access to healthcare is not equitable \u2013 the rich and the middle class will manage&#44; but what happens to the millions below the poverty line?<\/p><p>If any good comes out of this crisis&#44; then it will be India waking up to the reality that investing in health is paramount for economic growth and security. Ignoring health&#44; we have now learnt&#44; can cost the economy in trillions. India absolutely must invest at least 2.5% of the GDP on health&#44; and strengthen the primary health system. If not&#44; the next pandemic will be even worse. India must also better regulate and govern the large private health sector and make sure it works for the country.<\/p><h2>How do you think COVID-19 will/should change global policy approach towards communicable diseases?<\/h2><p>COVID-19 will change global health in many ways. The optimist in me hopes all countries will learn from the pandemic and invest in universal health coverage and re-affirm health as a human right. Global health must be more than just fighting one epidemic after another. I hope investments in public health and developmental assistance will no longer be viewed as a drain on resources. I hope countries will understand the need to build a social safety net for all.<\/p><p>The pessimist in me fears that the economic losses will force rich countries to scale back on international aid. India will need to be self-reliant and it is making progress towards that. But if COVID-19 depletes India\u2019s economy&#44; I really worry that India will spend even less on health&#44; despite understanding the critical importance of health during this pandemic.<\/p>","short_de":"\n \nMadhukar Pai&#44; is Canada Research Chair in Epidemiology &amp; Global Health and Director&#44; McGill Global Health Programs and Professor at McGill University.

But a more immediate need would be for the government to pay them minimum wages to ensure their survival.<\/p><p>\u201cOther than food&#44; migrant workers need to be provided money for addressing their other basic needs like healthcare&#44; education of their children&#44; rent and sustenance of their families.

They said government announcements that migrant workers need not pay rent and employers should pay them wages ignored the harsh realities of their lives. For one&#44; they lived in poor settlements where there was no formal rent agreements. Secondly&#44; most of the migrant population were self-employed like rickshaw-pullers. Thirdly&#44; the government had no record of people working in the informal sector.<\/p><p>\u201cThe financial package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana is inadequate to deal with the scale of the current crisis and many [components] of the scheme will not benefit migrant workers... \u20b91.7 lakh crore constitutes only around 1% of the GDP...
