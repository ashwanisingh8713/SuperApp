How can he literally stay an Supreme Court judgment? What temerity is this? Have you [government] even questioned him once for this?\u201d Justice Mishra lashed out at the DoT&#44; represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.\\<\/p><p>Mr. Mehta tried to pacify the judge&#44; saying \u201cWe all know about Your Lordship\u2019s benevolence...\u201d<\/p><p>Justice Mishra responded sharply&#44; \u201cNo&#44; you don\u2019t know me even an inch and we don\u2019t want respect from anybody in this world...
